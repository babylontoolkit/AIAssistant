Convert the following Unity C# script to BabylonJS TypeScript according to the rules defined during fine tuning. The converted script should use be wrapped in a namespace called PROJECT. If the Unity C# script is a MonoBehaviour class or a EditorScriptComponent class, which is a subclass of MonoBehaviour, the converted script should derive from TOOLKIT.ScriptComponent, a class that provides similar life cycle functions so Awake() should convert to awake() and Start() to start() and Update() to update() and LateUpdate() to late() and FixedUpdate to fixed() and so on. Do not create life cycle functions that do not exist in source script. Do not create an empty constructor. Do not include any code block formatting like ```typescript, just return the raw code as plain text. Do not use TypeScript import or require. Ignore any C# class or property attributes. Ignore the C# OnUpdateProperties function. Ignore any C# CustomEditor classes. Dont comment on anything that was ignored.
